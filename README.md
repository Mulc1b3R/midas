Visit the live Demo , drop in your API Key and begin training the Neural Network in your browser.
Predict the price of any stock ticker in the S&P 500.

### Method

... API key from =  https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

Clone the repo ; ```https://github.com/Mulc1b3R/midas.git```   or Fork it...
